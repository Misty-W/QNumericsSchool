# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do you provide certification?

The summer school is an informal workshop meant to serve the research community, and as such it is not accredited to offer diplomas. Every attendee will receive an *unaccredited* attestation of their participation with description of the covered material. The organizers will be able to provide reffers of reference for hackathon participants as well.

## What is included in the registration cost?

Lodging and lectures are included in the cost. Meals are not included, but the dining hall on campus is very convenient.

## What are the housing facilities?

Each attendee will have a private room, with shared bathroom facilities on the floor.

## Is parking available?

Free parking is plentiful on campus. Charging stations for EVs are available.

## Will personal laptops be required?

Bringing a personal laptop on which attendees can install and administer open source software is highly encouraged (e.g. Julia, Python, Rust, git, etc). A great deal of lecture content will be meant to be interactive and attendees will also have the opportunity to join for hackathons.

The organizers will not be able to provide laptops.

## What are the internet connectivity options on campus?

Both Eduroam and guest access options exist for internet connectivity.
